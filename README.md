**HOMMII GOLD Custom Maps**

  - Here are the Maps that me and Tanner made. All you need to do is clone the repository to your C:\GOG Games\HoMM 2 Gold\cloud_saves\MAPS or where ever your game looks at to load the custom games. That should automaticly update the game and when you launch the game it will show up in the expansion maps.
  - They are numbered in a specific way so that the game is able to find them and they are ordered in binary. if you open the MX2 in notepad it will show the name of the map on the top of the text. Make sure you don't edit this file directly.
